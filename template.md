## Abstract
<A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.>

## Motivation
<The motivation is critical for TIPs that want to change the TRON protocol. 
It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the TIP solves.>

## Specification
<The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.>

## Rationale
<The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing why particular design decisions were made.>

## Backwards Compatibility
<All TIPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity.>

## Implementation
<The implementations must be completed before any TIP is given status "Final".>
